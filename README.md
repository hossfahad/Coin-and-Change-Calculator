# Coin-and-Change-Calculator

This is my 3rd project on Python 3.0 demonstrating int values, strings and variables.
This will give the exact amount of change in a transaction from how much paid and cost using Python 3.0. Once the change is given, it will also return the amount received in quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.

Update 7/25 - I have decided to add an additional function which will separate the change in USD($) coins.

Update 7/26 - Major bug fixes for the change in transaction. 

Update 8/6 - I have added the coin functionality, though I am having a light difficulty in printing in to the user.

Update 8/6 - I have fixed getting the output to receive correct change from the biggest coin to smallest.

Update 8/7 - Added paper-bill functionality + minor changes in syntax.
